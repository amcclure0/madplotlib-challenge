## Final Observations:
1) The 4 most effective treatments yielded the greatest number of samples - while not explicitly stated this is likely due to mouse mortality during the timeframe of the study.
2) There was only a single outlier in the tumor volume data for the top 4 most effective treatments - the lack of upper bound outliers suggests that none of the mice saw exceptionally rapid tumor growth during treatment while the lack of lower bound outliers suggests that none of the treatments yielded radically better results in one specific mouse or group of mice versus another group.
3) There appears to be a clear correlation between mouse bodyweight and tumor volume - in general, larger mice have larger tumors and smaller mice smaller tumors. This is logical that tumor sizes would be scaled with bodyweight.
